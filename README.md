# Multi-agent System Process Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and operational flow for the **Multi-agent System Process** used to conduct structured, iterative research using lead and sub-agents with memory and citation management, enabling scalable, composable, and traceable research pipelines.

## Purpose

To:

* Decompose complex research queries into structured, parallelizable tasks handled by specialized sub-agents.
* Use an iterative research process for thorough coverage and refinement.
* Leverage memory for context retrieval and citation insertion for verifiable, reference-backed results.
* Provide clear traceability of agent decisions for auditability and improvement.

## Roles

* **User**: Sends the research query and receives structured, citation-backed results.
* **System**: Orchestrates the creation of the LeadResearcher agent and manages persistence.
* **LeadResearcher**: Plans the research approach, decomposes tasks, coordinates subagents, synthesizes results, and checks if further research is needed.
* **Subagent1, Subagent2, ...**: Perform focused web searches and evaluations on specific aspects of the research.
* **Memory**: Stores plans, context, and research iterations for retrieval during refinement.
* **CitationAgent**: Processes documents to identify citation locations and inserts citations before delivery.

## Process Flow

1. **User sends a research query.**
2. **System creates a LeadResearcher agent.**
3. **LeadResearcher plans the research approach** using `think (plan approach)`, saving the plan to **Memory**.
4. **LeadResearcher retrieves context** from **Memory** as needed.
5. **LeadResearcher decomposes the query**, creating subagents (Subagent1, Subagent2) for different aspects of the research.
6. Each **Subagent performs iterative research**:

   * Conducts a `web_search` for its assigned aspect.
   * Uses `think (evaluate)` to interpret and filter results.
   * Marks `complete_task` when finished.
7. **LeadResearcher synthesizes subagent results** and checks if further research is needed:

   * If yes, **continue loop** with additional iterations.
   * If no, **exit loop**.
8. **LeadResearcher completes the research task** with a compiled research report.
9. **CitationAgent processes the report**, inserting citations and verifying reference consistency.
10. **System persists the results** and returns the final research report with citations to the **User**.

## Key Features

* **Iterative Loop:** Allows refinement of research using new findings and context.
* **Modular Agents:** Enables parallel research across subdomains.
* **Memory Integration:** Supports consistent context across iterations.
* **Citation Handling:** Ensures research is verifiable and references are accessible.
* **Composable:** This architecture can be extended with additional agents (translation, summarization, critique) without disrupting the core process.

## Use Cases

* Structured academic or market research.
* Agent-based literature reviews.
* Competitive analysis for startups.
* Pre-training and fine-tuning of retrieval-augmented generation systems with traceable workflows.

## Future Extensions

* Add **CritiqueAgent** to review the report before citation insertion.
* Integrate **summarization layers** post-citation to produce abstracts or slide decks.
* Store citations in a structured vector store for later semantic retrieval.
* Implement **auto-feedback loops** to improve research quality based on user feedback.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Requirements Clarification**
   - Confirm your preferred tech stack (Python, Node.js, etc.).
   - Clarify if you want a CLI, web app, or API.
   - Determine if you want to use existing LLM APIs (OpenAI, etc.) or local models.

2. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Scaffold the project with clear directories for agents, memory, citation, and orchestration.
   - Set up dependency management (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.).

3. **Core Agent Implementations**
   - Implement the LeadResearcher agent: planning, task decomposition, synthesis.
   - Implement Subagents: web search, evaluation, task completion.
   - Implement Memory: context storage and retrieval.
   - Implement CitationAgent: citation detection and insertion.

4. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Build the system logic to manage agent creation, task flow, and persistence.
   - Ensure iterative loops and agent communication are robust.

5. **Interface Layer**
   - Provide a simple interface (CLI, API, or web) for users to submit queries and receive reports.

6. **Testing & Iteration**
   - Write unit and integration tests for each agent and the overall flow.
   - Run sample research queries to validate the pipeline.

7. **Documentation**
   - Document the codebase and provide usage instructions.
   - Update the README with any implementation-specific details.

8. **Future-Proofing**
   - Design the system to be modular for easy addition of new agents (CritiqueAgent, summarization, etc.).
   - Plan for future integration with vector stores and feedback loops.

## README Generation (for Cursor)

### Project Name:

`multi-agent-research-pipeline`

### Description:

A modular multi-agent research pipeline that decomposes user research queries, executes structured, iterative research using subagents, and returns citation-backed, verifiable reports.

### Key Features:

* LeadResearcher agent for task decomposition and synthesis.
* Subagents for parallel web search and evaluation.
* Iterative loop for refinement.
* Memory retrieval for consistent context.
* CitationAgent for citation insertion.
* Fully composable and extensible.

### Usage:

1. Pass a user research query into the system.
2. System spawns LeadResearcher.
3. LeadResearcher decomposes into subagents.
4. Subagents perform iterative research.
5. LeadResearcher synthesizes results and exits loop when complete.
6. CitationAgent inserts citations.
7. System returns structured research report.

### Future Work:

* Critique agent integration.
* Automated evaluation and grading pipelines.
* LLM-based retrieval and vector storage integration.
